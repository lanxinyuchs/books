\section{Introduction}

\subsection{About this document}

This document describes the link configuration interfaces provided by ITCLNH.

\subsection{Revision history}

\begin{dochistory}
PA1 & 20140610 & uabkiju: First version\\
\end{dochistory}

\section{Basic Concepts}

The user of these interfaces should be familiar with ITC. 
The provided interfaces allow a user to establish an ITC connection for 
locating a remote mailbox and exchanging messages between a local and a 
remote mailbox.

\section{LINK Configuration Interfaces}

ITCLNH provides the following interfaces:

\begin{itemize}
\item ECBC - ECBus Link Configuration interface.
\item EOLC - Emca OAM Link Configuration interface.
\item ROLC - Radio OAM Link Configuration interface.
\end{itemize}

\subsection{ECBC}

ITCLNH implements an ITC communication link on the EC bus (Equipment Control Bus). The 
transport layer is an implementation of HDLC unbalanced operation, normal reponse mode. To establish the
connection one side should be set up as a primary station and the other as a secondary station. 
See \hyperref[doxygen/ecb-link-api_8h]{ECBC interface description} for details.

\subsection{EOLC}

ITCLNH implements an ITC communication link between the DU host processor and the emca units.
The transport is an implementation on top of EBCOM. See \hyperref[doxygen/eolc-link-api_8h]
{ROLC interface description} for details.

\subsection{ROLC}

ITCLNH implements an ITC communication link between the DU host processor and the radio units.
The transport is an implementation of unbalanced Asynchronous Response Mode HDLC over the CPRI link. 
See \hyperref[doxygen/rolc-link-api_8h] {ROLC interface description} for details.
