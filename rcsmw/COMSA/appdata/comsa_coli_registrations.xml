    <description>
This will print some information about the internal state of ntpd, the data is somewhat decoded so as to be human readable.
It prints the overall state as well as detailed data for each association.

    <description>
This will print out all state data from the the process handling supervision of ntpd. Data is presented in human readable form, but it is still of fairly limited use, except for use during debug of ntpd supversion internals.

      module = "comsaNtpServer" function = "ecoli_print_traps">
    <description>
This will decode and print the traps received from the ntpd.
The single optional argument Verbosity controls how much information to print;
Verbosity:1 - print how many packets are in the log
Verbosity:2 - print traps, this is the default
Verbosity:3 - print traps and variables in payload 
Note that there is a limited number of traps saved in the log, there is room for about 20 traps, after this the oldest traps will be discarded. As each trap can be made up from multiple packets it is normal for the very oldest trap to fail to decode as it becomes incomplete as soon as the log become full.
