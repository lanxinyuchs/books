    <description>
This command is used to test what is to be input into the secM attribute: ManagedElement=1,SystemFunctions=1,SecM=1,UserManagement=1,LdapAuthenticationMethod=1,Ldap=1,Filter=1: filter.
This attribute requires a filter of the syntax described in RFC4515, but it also accepts the input of \"\" which results in the replacement of the current username.
The first argument which is mandatory should be a filter, e.g. (uid=smith), the second optional argument is a username that will be substituted into the filter if the special replacement syntax has been used.
