# Description:	appdata to run the binary namespace_simulator
# this binary will use the API (CTN) to connect via CEC to 
# ootServer. If OaMaccesspoint is set its namespace will be
# looked up. What is returned as OaM namespace is either "",
# meaning namespace not used, or something else depending on
# what the program "namespace_simulator" does (there will be
# some stuff in there to support developing this functionality).
# During normal operation in a complete system it is the job of
# TN to support CTN an OaM -> namespace lookup.
